# GurpBoy
A work in progres.

##About
Based on SolAZDev's Raspberry PiBoy5 project.
This is an ongoing project for my Fallout-based GURPS campaign, to replace character sheets.

Basically, there's two parts: a DM console and the Pip-Boy console.

The DM console can be used to update/add things to the database of weapons, perks, data, etc., and individually control each player's experience, inventory, and the like.

The Pip-Boy is used to track individual player's inventory and stats, including health, radiation, skills, and the like.
Also included is a hacking minigame for when players attempt to hack terminals, designed to replicate the in-game hacking. Lockpicking is also being considered.
